### Introduction

The React ChatBotify Gallery is a new project introduced alongside [**v2 of React ChatBotify**](https://medium.com/@tjtanjin/react-chatbotify-v2-beta-release-whats-changed-what-s-new-and-what-s-next-6aec9e049a98). The purpose of the gallery website is to provide developers with a central place for browsing, rating and sharing both themes and plugins. The website comes with an interactive theme preview feature, which allows developers to try out and visualise how the various themes look like. As an added bonus, the website also comes with a theme builder, which allows developers to directly craft and share themes by uploading them on the website.

Note that this repository contains the code for frontend portion of the gallery project. The backend code for the gallery project is separately maintained [here](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify-gallery-api).

### Features

The React ChatBotify Gallery Website offers the following core features:

- **Theme Previews:** Developers are able to select themes they wish to preview and interact with a live chatbot
- **Theme Builder:** Developers are able to build themes directly via the website and optionally, upload them to share with others
- **Plugin Browsing:** Developers can browse for plugins on the website (potentially try them out via a live preview as well - to be explored)
- **GitHub OAuth Login:** Login with GitHub to verify identifies for uploading and rating of themes
- **Authors Leaderboard:** Authors of themes and plugins will be ranked on a leaderboard based on the ratings received and number of themes/plugins contributed
- **Profile Page:** Developers can manage their own themes and plugins on their profile page

The above list is not exhaustive, but represents the majority of the key features for the gallery project.
